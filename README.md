# http_io

[![Build Status](https://github.com/dart-lang/http_io/workflows/Dart%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dart-lang/http_io/actions?query=workflow%3A"Dart+CI"+branch%3Amaster)

The HTTP APIs in `dart:io` are pure Dart code not relying on native runtime
calls. To enable faster development and bug fixes, these APIs are moving out of
`dart:io` into this package.

Watch the [dart-misc](https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!forum/misc)
mailing list for news about deprecation and migration.
